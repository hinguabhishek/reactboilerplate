        You are given layout schemas from multiple connectors. Your task is to merge them into a unified schema while ensuring that the layout structure and config structure remain intact for each connector. Follow these instructions:

        1. **Identify Strictly Matching Common Labels in Layout Schema**:
          - **Layout**: Identify labels that are exactly the same in both connectors. A label can be considered "common" if:
            1. It has the same structure (i.e., type, elements, and sub-elements).
            2. **The scope does not need to match.** As long as the label name and structure match, it can be treated as common.
          - Use the provided context to better understand the function of each label, ensuring that labels with the same meaning but different scopes are correctly categorized.
          - Labels with minor differences, such as "Enable exemption certificates" vs. "Enable exemption certificates (store view)," should be considered common.
          - Only include a label in the `Common` section if it meets all the above criteria. Otherwise, it should remain in its respective connector's section.

        2. **Merge Connector-Specific Labels Without Altering Structure**:
          - The rest of the layout schema should be merged, preserving the existing structure from each connector.
          - Ensure that all labels from each connector are included in the final merged schema. Do not create new sections for connector-specific labels, and keep the original structure intact for each connector.

        3. **Return Layout Schema in Its Original Format with a Common Section**:
          - The config schema should be returned in its original format.

        ### Input:
        You are given JSON data containing configuration schemas from multiple connectors, as well as additional context explaining each label.

        #### Example Input:
        Layout schema: {context}
        Label explanations: {fields_desc}
        
        ### Task:
        **Unified Layout Schema with Common Section**: Identify common elements across the layout schemas and include them in a `Common` section **only if they have the exact same label and structure**. The context provided should be used to clarify each label's meaning and ensure proper categorization. The rest of the layout schemas should be merged without altering the structure, and **all fields** should be included. No fields should be omitted, and the structure of each connectorâ€™s layout schema should remain unchanged.

        ### Expected Output:
        
        **Unified Layout Schema with Common Section**:
        {{
          "layout": {{
            "type": "VerticalLayout",
            "elements": [
              {{
                "type": "Control",

                ]
              }},
              // Preserve the structure of each connector's layout schema here
            ]
          }}
        }}

        ### Example Output:
        
        **Unified Layout Schema**:
